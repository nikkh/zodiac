# Deploying Zodiac

One supplementary aim of this project is to understand deployment with Github actions a lot better.  I'm far from an expert - so dont think the patterns I have used here are best proactice, they almost certainly are not.
However, one spin off benefit is that you should be able to deploy the whole Zodiac service (and its consituent microsoervices) very easily indeed.
